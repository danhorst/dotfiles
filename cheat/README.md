# Cheat

Cheat is a [handy gem](http://rubygems.org/gems/cheat) for storing and referencing notes on the command line.
It's set up to be a community repository of notes but I don't really use it that way.

At the moment [the project is a bit broken](https://github.com/defunkt/cheat/issues/14#issuecomment-13844713).
This is kind of a shame.
In the mean time since cheat caches "cheats" in `~/.cheat` I just put new cheats directly in there and keep them in this dotfiles repo.

Since `cheat sheets` doesn't work right now I have cobbled together a workaround for my use case.
I have an alias for `cheats` in [bash_aliases](https://github.com/danhorst/dotfiles/blob/master/bash_aliases) which lists the cheat files I have locally.

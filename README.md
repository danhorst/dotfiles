# Dotfiles

These dotfiles help me be productive using my preferred tools:

- `git`
- `ssh`
- `vim`
- [Ruby][1] runtime

I use them in two contexts:

1. My work laptop using [Windows Subsystem for Linux][2] (WSL) accessed via [Windows Terminal][3]
2. My phone using [Termux][4], often paired with a [Bluetooth mechanical keyboard][5] (`vim` works surprisingly well with the on-screen keyboard too)

## TODO

- [ ] Set up [Rust][6]
- [ ] Install Rust-based utilities:
  - [ ] [git-delta][7]
  - [ ] [ripgrep][8]
  - [ ] [xsv][9]

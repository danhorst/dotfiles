# My Dotfiles

## Purpose
This repository is a collection of scripts and configuration files I use in my day to day work.
Collecting them in this fashion eases the transition from workstation to workstation.

I use [boxen](http://boxen.github.com) to provision my mac for development.
There are [a number of ways](https://github.com/boxen/our-boxen/issues/103) to integrate your personal dotfiles so that they work with boxen modules.

## Installation
I clone this repo into `~/git/dotfiles` and symlink from there.
